/*
Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the
total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its
top-right corner (ax2, ay2).

The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its
top-right corner (bx2, by2).



Example 1:

Rectangle Area
Input: ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2
Output: 45
Example 2:

Input: ax1 = -2, ay1 = -2, ax2 = 2, ay2 = 2, bx1 = -2, by1 = -2, bx2 = 2, by2 =
2 Output: 16


Constraints:

-104 <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 104
-104 <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 104
-104 <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 104
-104 <= by1 <= by2 <= 104
