JavaScript ES6 Const

The const keyword makes it much easier to deal with constant variables at times.


Const

The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. A const variable identifier cannot be reassigned.

An initializer for a constant is required, i.e., its value must be specified in the same statement in which it's declared.

SAMPLE CODE

const ONE = 1;
ONE = 2;
console.log(ONE);

const TWO;
TWO = 2;
console.log(TWO);
OUTPUT

1
undefined
Task

PI and initialize it with Math.PI .
EULER and initialize it with Math.E .
SQRT2 and initialize it with Math.SQRT2 .
*/

//Write your code below this line.
const PI=Math.PI;
const EULER = Math.E;
const SQRT2 = Math.SQRT2;
