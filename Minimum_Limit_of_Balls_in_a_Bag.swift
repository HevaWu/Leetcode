/*
You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an integer maxOperations.

You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:

Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.
For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.
Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2 an you should return 2.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,17], maxOperations = 2
Output: 7


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 109

/*
Solution 1:
binary search maxSize of balls

check if current maxSize is maxSize, how many operations we need

For each penalty value, we split the balls into bags with this value.
For example, the mid = 3,
A[i] = 2, we split it into [2], and operations = 0
A[i] = 3, we split it into [3], and operations = 0
A[i] = 4, we split it into [3,1], and operations = 1
A[i] = 5, we split it into [3,2], and operations = 1
A[i] = 6, we split it into [3,3], and operations = 1
A[i] = 7, we split it into [3,3,1], and operations = 2

The number of operation we need is (a - 1) / mid

If the total operation > max operations,
the size of bag is too small,
we set left = mid + 1

Otherwise,
this size of bag is big enough,
we set right = mid

Time Complexity: O(nlogmaxBag)
Space Complexity: O(1)
