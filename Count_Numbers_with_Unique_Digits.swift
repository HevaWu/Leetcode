/*
Given an integer n, return the count of all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 <= x < 10n.



Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 91
Explanation: The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 â‰¤ x < 100, excluding 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99
Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: 1


Constraints:

0 <= n <= 8

Solution 1:
Math

Let f(n) = count of number with unique digits of length n.

f(1) = 10. (0, 1, 2, 3, ...., 9)

f(2) = 9 * 9. Because for each number i from 1, ..., 9, we can pick j to form a 2-digit number ij and there are 9 numbers that are different from i for j to choose from.

f(3) = f(2) * 8 = 9 * 9 * 8. Because for each number with unique digits of length 2, say ij, we can pick k to form a 3 digit number ijk and there are 8 numbers that are different from i and j for k to choose from.

Similarly f(4) = f(3) * 7 = 9 * 9 * 8 * 7....

...

f(10) = 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * ... * 1

f(11) = 0 = f(12) = f(13)....

any number with length > 10 couldn't be unique digits number.

The problem is asking for numbers from 0 to 10^n. Hence return f(1) + f(2) + .. + f(n)

var arr = [1, 9 , 9*9 , 9*9*8, 9*9*8*7, 9*9*8*7*6, 9*9*8*7*6*5, 9*9*8*7*6*5*4, 9*9*8*7*6*5*4*3, 9*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2, 9*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1]

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
