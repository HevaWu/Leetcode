/*
Let's say a positive integer is a super-palindrome if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome.

Given two positive integers left and right represented as strings, return the number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range [left, right].



Example 1:

Input: left = "4", right = "1000"
Output: 4
Explanation: 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes.
Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome: 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: left = "1", right = "2"
Output: 1


Constraints:

1 <= left.length, right.length <= 18
left and right consist of only digits.
left and right cannot have leading zeros.
left and right represent integers in the range [1, 1018].
left is less than or equal to right.
*/

/*
Solution 1:

- Say P = R^2is a super palindrome.
- Because RR is a palindrome, the first half of the digits in RR determine RR up to two possibilities. We can iterate through these digits: let kk be the first half of the digits in RR. For example, if k = 12344, then R = 1234321 or R = 12344321. Each possibility has either an odd or an even number of digits in RR.
- Notice because P < 10^{18}, R < (10^{18})^{\frac{1}{2}} = 10^9, and R = k | k', where k' is k reversed (and also possibly truncated by one digit); so that k < 10^5 = \small\text{MAGIC}, our magic constant.

Algorithm
- For each 1â‰¤k<MAGIC, let's create the associated palindrome R, and check whether R^2 is a palindrome.
- We should handle the odd and even possibilities separately, as we would like to break early so as not to do extra work.

To check whether an integer is a palindrome, we could check whether it is equal to its reverse. To create the reverse of an integer, we can do it digit by digit.

Time Complexity: O(W^{\frac{1}{4}} * \log W), where W = 10^{18} is our upper limit for RR. The \log WlogW term comes from checking whether each candidate is the root of a palindrome.
Space Complexity: O(logW), the space used to create the candidate palindrome.
