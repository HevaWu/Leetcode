/*
Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.

/*Since each of the 32 bits follow the same rules, we just need to consider 1 bit. We know a number appears 3 times at most, so we need 2 bits to store that. Now we have 4 state, 00, 01, 10 and 11, but we only need 3 of them.

In this solution, 00, 01 and 10 are chosen. Let 'ones' represents the first bit, 'twos' represents the second bit. Then we need to set rules for 'ones' and 'twos' so that they act as we hopes. The complete loop is 00->10->01->00(0->1->2->3/0).

For 'ones', we can get 'ones = ones ^ A[i]; if (twos == 1) then ones = 0', that can be tansformed to 'ones = (ones ^ A[i]) & ~twos'.

Similarly, for 'twos', we can get 'twos = twos ^ A[i]; if (ones* == 1) then twos = 0' and 'twos = (twos ^ A[i]) & ~ones'. Notice that 'ones*' is the value of 'ones' after calculation, that is why twos is
calculated later.*/
