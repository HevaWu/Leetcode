Explanation

Variables can be thought of as named containers where we can store data. 
Data stored inside a variable can be retrieved by naming it at a later point.

A variable in JavaScript is declared by using the var keyword:

SAMPLE CODE

var website = "hackerrank";     //Variable Declaration

console.log(website);           //Displaying variable website's content to console.
OUTPUT

hackerrank
