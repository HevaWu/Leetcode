/*382. Linked List Random Node   QuestionEditorial Solution  My Submissions
Total Accepted: 13860 Total Submissions: 30362 Difficulty: Medium Contributors: Admin
Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.

Follow up:
What if the linked list is extremely large and its length is unknown to you? Could you solve this efficiently without using extra space?

Example:

// Init a singly linked list [1,2,3].
ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
head.next = new ListNode(2);
head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
Solution solution = new Solution(head);

// getRandom() should return either 1, 2, or 3 randomly. Each element should have equal probability of returning.
solution.getRandom();

Reservoir Sampling
PROBLEM:
Choose k entries from n numbers. Make sure each number is selected with the probability of k/n

BASIC IDEA:
Choose 1, 2, 3, ..., k first and put them into the reservoir.
For k+1, pick it with a probability of k/(k+1), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
For k+i, pick it with a probability of k/(k+i), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
Repeat until k+i reaches n

PROOF:
For k+i, the probability that it is selected and will replace a number in the reservoir is k/(k+i)
For a number in the reservoir before (let's say X), the probability that it keeps staying in the reservoir is
P(X was in the reservoir last time) × P(X is not replaced by k+i)
= P(X was in the reservoir last time) × (1 - P(k+i is selected and replaces X))
= k/(k+i-1) × （1 - k/(k+i) × 1/k）
= k/(k+i)
When k+i reaches n, the probability of each number staying in the reservoir is k/n
