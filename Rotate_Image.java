/*
 * You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by
 * 90 degrees (clockwise).
 *
 * You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the
 * input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the
 * rotation.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
 * Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
 * Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
 * 1 <= n <= 20
 * -1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000

Solution 2: Rotate 4 rectangle
Now the solution is quite straightforward - one could move across the elements in the first rectangle and rotate them using a temp list of 4 elements.
//
for [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
the one we need to process is [1,4]
for 1, temp = [1,3,9,7], rotate it
for 4, temp = [2,6,8,4], rotate it
//
Time complexity : O(n^2) is a complexity given by two inserted loops.
Space complexity : O(1) since we do a rotation in place and allocate only the list of 4 elements as a temporary helper.
